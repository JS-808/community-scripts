#Community Script Downloader V3

A complete rework is here—now in Python and packaged as an .exe for easy use.
This tool helps you quickly download community scripts until the official SDN (Script Delivery Network) is ready.

How to use:
Download and run the .exe (Windows may say it's blocked; click “More info” > “Run anyway”).
All scripts are selected by default; hit “Download” to grab them all, or uncheck the ones you don’t want.
"Deselect All" and other improved controls are included for easy selection.

Please report any issues in the Discord thread for this script.
